1. Comparison Assignment
Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases
1. Structure

Flat File Systems

Store data in simple files (e.g., CSV, TXT) with no inherent structure beyond rows and columns.

Typically consist of a single table per file.

No built-in schema enforcement; structure may vary between files.

Relational Databases

Store data in multiple interrelated tables with defined schemas.

Use a formal data model with columns, data types, keys, and constraints.

Support SQL for structured queries.
 
2. Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems

High redundancy because data is often duplicated across files.

Lack mechanisms to enforce consistency or avoid duplication.

Relational Databases

Minimized redundancy through normalization.

Data stored once and referenced via keys, reducing inconsistencies.

3. Relationships

Flat File Systems

No native relationship support.

Any relationships must be manually handled in application logic.

Relational Databases

Built-in relationships using primary and foreign keys.

Enforce referential integrity, cascading rules, and consistency.

4. Example Usage

Flat File Systems

Configuration files.

Simple logging or archival systems.

Small datasets for lightweight applications.

Import/export formats like CSV for data interchange.

Relational Databases

Enterprise systems (ERP, CRM).

Financial systems.

E-commerce platforms.

Any system requiring complex queries or large-scale structured data. 
5. Drawbacks

Flat File Systems

Difficult to manage at scale.

High redundancy and inconsistency.

No transaction support or concurrency control.

Poor performance for complex queries.

Relational Databases

More complex to set up and maintain.

Require specialized knowledge (SQL, schema design).

Can be slower for extremely large or unstructured data without proper indexing.

May involve licensing costs (for some engines).

Types of Databases
Relational vs Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases
✅ Relational Databases

Data is stored in tables (rows and columns), with a fixed/predefined schema. 
GeeksforGeeks
+2
GeeksforGeeks
+2

Use SQL (Structured Query Language) to query and manipulate data. 
GeeksforGeeks
+1

Support ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which ensures reliable, consistent transactions — important when data integrity is critical. 
insightsoftware
+1

Great for structured, relational data — where entities relate to each other (e.g. customers, orders, invoices, relationships). 
GeeksforGeeks
+1

When relational DBs shine:

Financial/ banking systems (transactions must be consistent)

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) / Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

Systems needing complex queries, joins across tables, strong consistency
✅ Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases

Data is stored using flexible models — e.g. document-oriented (like JSON), key-value, wide-column, graph, etc. 
ProCoders
+2
GeeksforGeeks
+2

Schema is dynamic / schema-less, which allows fields to vary across records — good for evolving data. 
GeeksforGeeks
+2
AppMaster
+2

Typically favor horizontal scalability, distributing data across many machines/servers rather than scaling up a single server. 
AppMaster
+2
GeeksforGeeks
+2

May trade off the strictness of ACID (some use eventual consistency or tunable consistency) in favor of scalability, flexibility, and performance. 
AppMaster

Examples:

MongoDB – a document store using BSON (binary JSON) documents; good for unstructured / varying data. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+2
GeeksforGeeks
+2

Apache Cassandra – a wide-column (column-family) store, optimized for large-scale data across many servers, high write throughput. 
GeeksforGeeks
+2
Wikipedia
+2

When NoSQL shines:

Applications with rapidly evolving data structures (e.g. user profiles, product catalogs, metadata)

High-traffic web apps, social media, content management systems

Big data ingest, analytics, log storage, IoT data, where you expect large volumes and flexible schema

🛠 Centralized vs Distributed vs Cloud Databases

These terms describe how and where the database is deployed / stored (architecture), rather than strictly the data model (SQL vs NoSQL).



📍 Centralized Database

All data resides on a single server or location (e.g. a central server, mainframe, on-premises machine). 
Wikipedia
+2
GeeksforGeeks
+2

Advantages: easier to manage, simpler backups, data consistency (single source), minimal duplication. 
GeeksforGeeks
+1

Disadvantages: Scalability is limited (can only scale by upgrading hardware), single point of failure (if server crashes — data inaccessible), performance bottleneck with many users. 
Wikipedia
+2
Educative
+2

Use cases:

Small to medium-size organizations where data size is modest and workload is limited

Environments where strong consistency, central control, and simplicity are more important than large-scale distribution (e.g. small business ERP, local desktop applications, small internal systems)

🌐 Distributed Database

Data is spread across multiple servers or physical locations (nodes), often connected via network. The system manages distribution so that to the user it behaves as a single database. 
Wikipedia
+2
TechTarget
+2

Advantages: Scalable horizontally (add more servers instead of upgrading one), higher availability and fault tolerance (if one node fails, others continue), better performance for geographically distributed users (data can be placed closer to users). 
Oracle
+2
Wikipedia
+2

Disadvantages: more complex to manage, harder to guarantee global consistency, data synchronization & replication overhead, more costly infrastructure. 
Educative
+2
Kurukshetra University
+2

Use cases:

Large-scale systems needing to serve many users across different regions (global apps, multi-region services)

High-availability systems where downtime must be minimized (e.g. streaming services, global e-commerce, real-time analytics)

Big data systems, or systems needing to scale out as data volume grows

Examples of distributed databases:

Apache Cassandra — widely used for distributed, fault-tolerant data storage. 
TechTarget
+1

Apache HBase — distributed NoSQL database for very large tables, often used with Hadoop. 
Wikipedia
+1

Other distributed DBMS: Apache Ignite, Couchbase, etc.

Cloud Database

A database hosted on a cloud computing platform (public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid), rather than on-premises servers. 
TechTarget
+1

From the user/app perspective, a cloud database “looks like” any other database (structured or unstructured), but the underlying infrastructure (storage, compute, replication, backups) is managed by the cloud provider. 
TechTarget
+1

Pros: reduces burden on internal IT/DBA for infrastructure management, often offers easy scalability, automated backups, high availability. 
TechTarget
+2
Wikipedia
+2

Many cloud databases also support distributed architectures under the hood (sharding, replication across datacenters) — giving both benefits of distribution + cloud management convenience. 
Wikipedia
+1

Use cases:

Applications needing quick deployment without heavy infra investment

Startups or small teams that want to outsource DB operations

Global applications requiring scalability, replication, geo-distribution, without needing to manage data centers themselves
