1. Comparison Assignment
Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases
1. Structure

Flat File Systems

Store data in simple files (e.g., CSV, TXT) with no inherent structure beyond rows and columns.

Typically consist of a single table per file.

No built-in schema enforcement; structure may vary between files.

Relational Databases

Store data in multiple interrelated tables with defined schemas.

Use a formal data model with columns, data types, keys, and constraints.

Support SQL for structured queries.
 
2. Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems

High redundancy because data is often duplicated across files.

Lack mechanisms to enforce consistency or avoid duplication.

Relational Databases

Minimized redundancy through normalization.

Data stored once and referenced via keys, reducing inconsistencies.

3. Relationships

Flat File Systems

No native relationship support.

Any relationships must be manually handled in application logic.

Relational Databases

Built-in relationships using primary and foreign keys.

Enforce referential integrity, cascading rules, and consistency.

4. Example Usage

Flat File Systems

Configuration files.

Simple logging or archival systems.

Small datasets for lightweight applications.

Import/export formats like CSV for data interchange.

Relational Databases

Enterprise systems (ERP, CRM).

Financial systems.

E-commerce platforms.

Any system requiring complex queries or large-scale structured data. 
5. Drawbacks

Flat File Systems

Difficult to manage at scale.

High redundancy and inconsistency.

No transaction support or concurrency control.

Poor performance for complex queries.

Relational Databases

More complex to set up and maintain.

Require specialized knowledge (SQL, schema design).

Can be slower for extremely large or unstructured data without proper indexing.

May involve licensing costs (for some engines).
