1. Comparison Assignment
Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases
1. Structure

Flat File Systems

Store data in simple files (e.g., CSV, TXT) with no inherent structure beyond rows and columns.

Typically consist of a single table per file.

No built-in schema enforcement; structure may vary between files.

Relational Databases

Store data in multiple interrelated tables with defined schemas.

Use a formal data model with columns, data types, keys, and constraints.

Support SQL for structured queries.
 
2. Data Redundancy

Flat File Systems

High redundancy because data is often duplicated across files.

Lack mechanisms to enforce consistency or avoid duplication.

Relational Databases

Minimized redundancy through normalization.

Data stored once and referenced via keys, reducing inconsistencies.

3. Relationships

Flat File Systems

No native relationship support.

Any relationships must be manually handled in application logic.

Relational Databases

Built-in relationships using primary and foreign keys.

Enforce referential integrity, cascading rules, and consistency.

4. Example Usage

Flat File Systems

Configuration files.

Simple logging or archival systems.

Small datasets for lightweight applications.

Import/export formats like CSV for data interchange.

Relational Databases

Enterprise systems (ERP, CRM).

Financial systems.

E-commerce platforms.

Any system requiring complex queries or large-scale structured data. 
5. Drawbacks

Flat File Systems

Difficult to manage at scale.

High redundancy and inconsistency.

No transaction support or concurrency control.

Poor performance for complex queries.

Relational Databases

More complex to set up and maintain.

Require specialized knowledge (SQL, schema design).

Can be slower for extremely large or unstructured data without proper indexing.

May involve licensing costs (for some engines).

Roles in a Database System

1. System Analyst

What they do:

Study the business needs and processes of an organization.

Determine what the database system should accomplish.

Create requirements documents, process flow diagrams, and system specifications.

Focus: Business requirements → System requirements.

Output: Requirements for the database and applications, used by designers and developers.

2. Database Designer

What they do:

Convert the requirements from the System Analyst into a conceptual and logical database model.

Design entity-relationship (ER) diagrams, data models, constraints, relationships, normalization, etc.

In some cases they also create the physical database design (indexing, partitions, storage).

Focus: Data structure, data relationships, data integrity.

Output: Database schema/design.
 3. Database Developer

What they do:

Implement the physical database based on the design.

Write SQL scripts, stored procedures, triggers, functions, and database logic.

Optimize queries and create indexes to improve performance.

Focus: Building and coding the database.

Output: The functioning database and database logic.

4. DBA (Database Administrator)

What they do:

Maintain, secure, and manage the database system after it is built.

Handle user accounts, permissions, backups, recovery, monitoring, and performance tuning.

Ensure availability, reliability, and security of the data.

Focus: Operations, maintenance, and administration.

Output: Stable, secure, high-performing database environment.
5. Application Developer

What they do:

Build the software applications that interact with the database.

Write application logic using languages such as Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.

Use APIs, ORMs, and SQL queries to access and manipulate data.

Focus: User-facing application and business logic.

Output: Applications that read/write data from/to the database.
6. BI (Business Intelligence) Developer

What they do:

Use the database to create reports, dashboards, analytics, and insights.

Work with data warehouses, ETL processes, and visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau, SSIS, etc.).

Transform raw data into meaningful information for decision-making.
